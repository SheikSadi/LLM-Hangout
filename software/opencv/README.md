## Q:  Help me understand make, cmake, caffe.
> **ChatGPT**

Certainly! Let's break down each of these terms:

1.  **Make:**
    
    *   **Definition:** `make` is a build automation tool that is used to compile and build projects. It reads a file called `Makefile` to determine how to build and compile the project.
    *   **Usage:** Developers use `make` to define a set of rules in the `Makefile` that specify how the project should be built. These rules typically include dependencies and actions to be taken for compilation.
2.  **CMake:**
    
    *   **Definition:** `CMake` is a cross-platform build system generator. It is used to manage the build process in a platform-independent way. CMake generates native makefiles or project files that can be used with different build tools on different platforms (e.g., Make, Visual Studio, Xcode).
    *   **Usage:** Developers create a `CMakeLists.txt` file that contains instructions for building the project. CMake then generates the appropriate build files based on the target platform.
3.  **Caffe:**
    
    *   **Definition:** Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is an open-source deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC). It is particularly well-suited for image classification and other computer vision tasks.
    *   **Usage:** Caffe provides a collection of tools and libraries for training and deploying deep learning models. It uses a defined set of layer types and a Python interface for easy integration into deep learning workflows.

In summary:

*   `make` is a general-purpose build tool that reads instructions from a `Makefile` to build a project.
*   `CMake` is a higher-level build system generator that creates platform-specific build files from a more abstract set of instructions defined in a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
*   `Caffe` is a deep learning framework that provides tools and libraries for building and deploying convolutional neural networks.

When working with Caffe or similar projects, you may use `CMake` to configure and generate the necessary build files, and then use `make` to actually build and compile the project based on those files.



## Q: How to build opencv for python with GPU support on Ubuntu 20.04?
> **ChatGPT**

Building OpenCV with GPU support on Ubuntu 20.04 involves a few steps. Before you begin, ensure that you have a compatible GPU and that you have installed the necessary GPU drivers. Additionally, you need to have CMake, Git, and other dependencies installed on your system. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \ libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \ libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \ gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python3-numpy \ libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev
    ```
    
2.  **Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN (Optional, if you have an NVIDIA GPU):**
    
    *   Follow the instructions on the NVIDIA website to install the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN.
3.  **Clone OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib Repositories:**
    
    
    `git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git`
    
4.  **Create a Build Directory:**
    
    
    `cd opencv mkdir build cd build`
    
5.  **Configure CMake:**
    
    *   Replace `<path_to_opencv_contrib>` with the actual path to the `opencv_contrib` directory.
    
    
    `bash
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
        -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
        -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \
        -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
        -D OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON \
        -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<path_to_opencv_contrib>/modules \
        -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
        -D WITH_CUDA=ON \
        -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \
        -D OPENCV_DNN_CUDA=ON \
        -D ENABLE_FAST_MATH=1 \
        -D CUDA_FAST_MATH=1 \
        -D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=7.5 \
        -D WITH_CUBLAS=1 \
        ..
    ```
    
    *   Adjust the `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` value based on your GPU architecture. You can find your GPU architecture in the NVIDIA documentation.
6.  **Build OpenCV:**
    
    
    `make -j$(nproc)`
    
7.  **Install OpenCV:**
    
    
    `sudo make install sudo ldconfig`
    
8.  **Check OpenCV Installation:**
    
    *   Open a Python terminal and run the following:
    
    pythonCopy code
    
    `import cv2 print(cv2.__version__) print(cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount())`
    
    If everything is set up correctly, you should see the OpenCV version and the number of CUDA-enabled devices.
    

Note: This guide assumes you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU. If you have a different GPU or no GPU at all, you may need to adjust the CMake options accordingly. Additionally, it's essential to check the OpenCV and CUDA documentation for any updates or changes in the build process.



## Q: I want run a command to check which ones I have installed and which ones not. build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \\ libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \\ libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \\ gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python3-numpy \\ libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev
> **ChatGPT**

You can use the `dpkg` command to check which of the specified packages are installed on your Ubuntu system. Here's a command that lists the installed and missing packages:

bashCopy code

```bash
    dpkg -l build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \ libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \ libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \ gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python3-numpy \ libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev | awk '/^ii/{print $2}' > installed_packages.txt  comm -23 <(sort required_packages.txt) <(sort installed_packages.txt) > missing_packages.txt  echo "Installed Packages:" cat installed_packages.txt  echo "Missing Packages:" cat missing_packages.txt
```

Explanation:

*   `dpkg -l`: Lists all installed packages.
*   `awk '/^ii/{print $2}'`: Extracts the names of installed packages.
*   `comm -23 <(sort required_packages.txt) <(sort installed_packages.txt)`: Compares the list of required packages with the installed packages and outputs the names of missing packages.
*   The results are saved to `installed_packages.txt` and `missing_packages.txt`.

Make sure to replace `required_packages.txt` with the list of packages you provided earlier. If a package is listed in "Missing Packages," you can install it using `sudo apt-get install package-name`.



## Q: I want video I/O enabled and want to work with mp4v and other popular codecs using opencv. Is the above packages sufficient?
> **ChatGPT**

The packages you provided in your initial list include many dependencies needed for building OpenCV, but for specific video codec support, you might need additional libraries and their development headers. For video I/O and popular codecs like mp4v, you'll need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies.

Here are some additional packages you can consider for extended video codec support:

bashCopy code

`sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \ libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libavresample-dev`

This will install development headers for additional video codecs and support libraries. Including these in your build configuration when running CMake will help OpenCV include support for various video formats.

When running CMake, make sure that you see the relevant entries indicating the presence of these libraries. For example, you should see entries like `FFMPEG` in the CMake output, indicating that support for additional video codecs is being included.

Keep in mind that the availability of certain codecs might also depend on the external libraries installed on your system. If you encounter issues with a specific codec, you may need to install the required libraries or check the OpenCV documentation for additional recommendations.

Remember to adjust your CMake configuration accordingly, for example, by adding or updating the following lines:

bashCopy code

`-D WITH_FFMPEG=ON \ -D WITH_XINE=ON \`

These options enable support for FFmpeg and Xine, respectively, which are commonly used for video I/O in OpenCV.



## Q: Explain this argument in cmake for opencv build -D CUDA\_ARCH\_BIN=7.5 \\
> **ChatGPT**

The `-D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=7.5` argument in CMake for OpenCV build specifies the compute capability of the NVIDIA GPU architecture for which the CUDA code should be generated. Let's break down what this argument means:

*   `-D`: This is a CMake option to set a variable.
    
*   `CUDA_ARCH_BIN`: This variable specifies the compute architecture for which the CUDA code should be compiled.
    
*   `7.5`: This specific value represents the compute capability of the NVIDIA GPU architecture. In this case, 7.5 corresponds to the CUDA compute capability of the GPU.
    

Compute capability is a numerical representation of the features supported by a specific GPU architecture. Different GPU models have different compute capabilities, and it's essential to set this option to match the architecture of the GPU you intend to use. CUDA code is compiled with optimizations and features that are specific to the compute capability of the targeted GPU.

For example, CUDA\_ARCH\_BIN=7.5 indicates that the generated CUDA code will be optimized for a GPU with compute capability 7.5. If you have a different NVIDIA GPU with a different compute capability, you should replace 7.5 with the appropriate value.

To find out the compute capability of your GPU, you can refer to the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs documentation or use the following command:

bashCopy code

`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_capability --format=csv,noheader`

This command will output the compute capability of your GPU, and you can use that value when setting the `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` variable during the OpenCV CMake configuration.



## Q: nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute\_capability --format=csv,noheader Field "compute\_capability" is not a valid field to query.
> **ChatGPT**

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `compute_capability` field might not be available in your version of `nvidia-smi`. Instead, you can use the following command to get information about the GPU and its compute capability:

bashCopy code

`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,driver_version,compute_capability --format=csv`

This command will provide information about the GPU name, driver version, and compute capability. Look for the `compute_capability` column, and note the value for your GPU. You can then use this value when setting the `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` variable in the OpenCV CMake configuration.

For example, if the `compute_capability` value is 7.5, your CMake configuration might include:

bashCopy code

`-D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=7.5`

Replace 7.5 with the actual compute capability of your GPU. If you don't find the `compute_capability` field in the output, you can usually find information about the compute capability in the GPU specifications provided by NVIDIA.



## Q: It didn't work as well. What are other wasy of finding CUDA\_ARCH\_BIN? I am using cuda 12.2 using Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 (nvidia driver 535)

2 / 2
> **ChatGPT**

I apologize for the confusion. To determine the CUDA compute capability for a specific GPU, you can refer to the official NVIDIA CUDA GPUs documentation. Alternatively, you can use the `deviceQuery` utility that comes with the CUDA toolkit.

Here's how you can use `deviceQuery`:

1.  Locate the `deviceQuery` executable in your CUDA toolkit installation. It's typically found in the `extras/demo_suite` directory.
    
    
    `cd /path/to/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery`
    
2.  Compile the `deviceQuery` utility.
    
    
    `make`
    
3.  Run the compiled `deviceQuery` executable.
    
    
    `./deviceQuery`
    
    Look for the "CUDA Capability" field in the output. It will show the compute capability of your GPU.
    

If you're using CUDA 12.2 and have a GeForce GTX 1050, the compute capability is typically 6.1. You can set the `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` variable in your OpenCV CMake configuration accordingly:

bashCopy code

`-D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=6.1`

Please adjust this value based on the output from `deviceQuery` or refer to the official NVIDIA CUDA GPUs documentation for the accurate compute capability of your GPU model.



## Q: Where is typically nvcc installed?
> **ChatGPT**

The `nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) is typically installed as part of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. The exact location can vary depending on how you installed the toolkit and the version of the toolkit you are using. Here are some common locations:

1.  **Default Installation Path:**
    
    *   On Linux, the default installation path is often `/usr/local/cuda`.
    *   On Windows, it might be something like `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\vX.Y`, where `X.Y` is the CUDA version.
2.  **PATH Environment Variable:**
    
    *   The directory containing `nvcc` might be added to the `PATH` environment variable during installation, allowing you to run `nvcc` from any directory in the command line.
3.  **Search for the Executable:**
    
    *   You can use the `which` command on Linux or `where` command on Windows to locate the executable in the command line:
        
            
        `which nvcc`
        
        or on Windows:
        
        cmdCopy code
        
        `where nvcc`
        
    *   This will show you the full path to the `nvcc` executable.
        

If you have trouble finding `nvcc`, you can also perform a system-wide search for the executable, as its location may depend on your system's configuration and installation options.



## Q: How to export an env variable during the start of bash shell?
> **ChatGPT**

To export an environment variable during the start of a Bash shell, you can add the export command to one of the shell configuration files. The two common files for this purpose are `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile`. Here are the steps:

1.  **Edit `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`):** Open the `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor using a command like:
    
    
    `nano ~/.bashrc`
    
    Or for `~/.bash_profile`:
    
    
    `nano ~/.bash_profile`
    
2.  **Add the `export` command:** Add a line to export your environment variable. For example:
    
    
    `export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"`
    
    Replace `"some_value"` with the value you want to assign to the environment variable.
    
3.  **Save and exit the text editor:**
    
    *   In Nano, you can save changes by pressing `Ctrl` + `O`, then press `Enter`. Exit by pressing `Ctrl` + `X`.
    *   In other text editors, follow the appropriate steps to save and exit.
4.  **Apply the changes:** After saving the changes, you can either start a new terminal or run the following command to apply the changes to the current session:
    
    
    `source ~/.bashrc`
    
    Or for `~/.bash_profile`:
    
    
    `source ~/.bash_profile`
    

Now, whenever you start a new Bash shell, the environment variable `MY_VARIABLE` with the specified value will be available in that shell session.

Remember that changes to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` will affect new terminal sessions. If you want to apply the changes to the current terminal session without restarting it, use the `source` command as shown above.



## Q: What does cmake .. do? The last argument is not clear to me.

2 / 2
> **ChatGPT**

The `cmake ..` command is used to invoke CMake in the parent directory of the current directory. The `..` is a shorthand notation for the parent directory.

Here's what each part of the command means:

*   **`cmake`:** This is the command to run CMake.
    
*   **`..`:** This is a relative path that refers to the parent directory of the current working directory. In the context of a command line, `..` represents the parent directory.
    

When you run `cmake ..` in a specific directory (let's call it the build directory), CMake generates build files based on the CMakeLists.txt file found in the parent directory. It effectively tells CMake to configure the build based on the project specifications in the parent directory.

For example, if you have the following directory structure:

luaCopy code

`my_project/ |-- CMakeLists.txt  # CMake configuration file |-- src/ |-- build/`

You would typically navigate to the `build` directory and run `cmake ..` to configure the build based on the settings specified in `my_project/CMakeLists.txt`. This is a common practice to keep the source code directory clean and separate from the build artifacts.

The `..` notation is used in various command-line contexts (not just in CMake) to represent the parent directory. It's a convenient way to reference directories relative to the current location.



## Q: How to check if a directory exists in bash?
> **ChatGPT**

In Bash, you can use the `-d` test operator to check if a directory exists. Here's a simple example:

bashCopy code

`directory="/path/to/your/directory"  if [ -d "$directory" ]; then     echo "Directory exists" else     echo "Directory does not exist" fi`

In this example, replace `"/path/to/your/directory"` with the actual path you want to check. The `-d` test operator checks if the specified path is a directory, and if it is, the condition is true, and the "Directory exists" message is printed; otherwise, the "Directory does not exist" message is printed.

You can use this logic within scripts or directly in the Bash command line.



## Q: How to check if a file exist in bash?
> **ChatGPT**

In Bash, you can use the `-e` test operator to check if a file exists. Here's an example:

bashCopy code

`file="/path/to/your/file.txt"  if [ -e "$file" ]; then     echo "File exists" else     echo "File does not exist" fi`

Replace `"/path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path of the file you want to check. The `-e` test operator checks if the specified path exists, whether it's a regular file, directory, or another type of file. If the path exists, the condition is true, and the script or command will execute the corresponding code block; otherwise, the condition is false, and the alternative block will execute.

You can use similar logic within scripts or directly in the Bash command line.



## Q: Explain: -D CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/usr/local
> **ChatGPT**

The `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local` option in CMake is used to specify the installation directory for the build artifacts. Let's break down what each part of this option means:

*   **`-D`:** This option is used to define a variable in CMake. It allows you to set the value of a variable during the configuration phase of CMake.
    
*   **`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:** This is a CMake variable that represents the base directory where the project will be installed.
    
*   **`/usr/local`:** This is the value assigned to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable. It specifies the installation directory for the project. In this case, it is set to the standard system-wide installation directory `/usr/local`.
    

Putting it all together, when you use `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local` in your CMake configuration command, you are telling CMake to set the installation prefix to `/usr/local`. This means that when you later run the `make install` command after successfully building your project, the project files (binaries, libraries, headers, etc.) will be installed under the `/usr/local` directory on your system.

It's worth noting that `/usr/local` is a common location for locally installed software on Unix-like systems. However, you can customize this path to another directory if you prefer by changing the value assigned to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. For example:

bashCopy code

`-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/preferred/directory`

This allows you to control where the project files will be installed when the installation step is executed.



## Q: I do have cuDNN installed. Is it due to $PATH? CMake Error at modules/dnn/CMakeLists.txt:53 (message): DNN: CUDA backend requires cuDNN. Please resolve dependency or disable OPENCV\_DNN\_CUDA=OFF
> **ChatGPT**

Yes, the error you're encountering is likely because CMake is unable to find the cuDNN library, and this issue could be related to the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1.  **Check cuDNN Installation:**
    
    *   Ensure that cuDNN is correctly installed on your system.
    *   Verify the installation path of cuDNN.
2.  **Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**
    
    *   Add the directory containing the cuDNN library to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can do this temporarily in the current session or permanently in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`).
        
            
        `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cudnn/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
        
        Replace `/path/to/cudnn/lib` with the actual path to the cuDNN library directory.
        
3.  **Set `PATH` (if needed):**
    
    *   Ensure that the directory containing the cuDNN binaries is in your `PATH`:
        
            
        `export PATH=/path/to/cudnn/bin:$PATH`
        
        Replace `/path/to/cudnn/bin` with the actual path to the cuDNN binary directory.
        
4.  **Re-run CMake:**
    
    *   After setting the environment variables, re-run your CMake configuration command.
        
            
        `cmake ..`
        
    *   Ensure that the cuDNN-related options are correctly set in your CMake configuration, for example:
        
            
        `-D WITH_CUDA=ON \ -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \ -D OPENCV_DNN_CUDA=ON \`
        
    *   If you encounter issues, check the CMake output for any messages related to cuDNN.
        
5.  **Check CMake Cache:**
    
    *   If you still encounter issues, you might need to clear the CMake cache and re-run the configuration. This ensures that changes in environment variables and options are taken into account.
        
            
        `rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/ cmake ..`
        

Make sure to adjust the paths in the commands above based on the actual installation paths on your system. If you continue to face issues, double-check the cuDNN installation documentation and the OpenCV documentation for any additional considerations.



## Q: Verify cuDNN installation
> **ChatGPT**

To verify cuDNN installation on your system, you can perform the following checks:

1.  **Check cuDNN Version:**
    
    *   You can find the version of cuDNN by checking the header file. Open the cuDNN header file and look for the version information:
        
            
        `cat /path/to/cudnn/include/cudnn_version.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2`
        
    *   Replace `/path/to/cudnn` with the actual path to your cuDNN installation.
        
2.  **Check cuDNN Library:**
    
    *   Ensure that the cuDNN library files are present in the specified installation directory. The library files are typically named like `libcudnn.so` on Linux or `cudnn64_*.dll` on Windows.
        
            
        `ls /path/to/cudnn/lib`
        
    *   Replace `/path/to/cudnn` with the actual path to your cuDNN installation.
        
3.  **Compile and Run cuDNN Samples:**
    
    *   cuDNN comes with a set of samples that you can compile and run to verify the installation. These samples are usually located in the `samples` directory within the cuDNN installation directory.
        
            
        `cd /path/to/cudnn/samples make ./mnistCUDNN`
        
    *   Replace `/path/to/cudnn` with the actual path to your cuDNN installation.
        
4.  **Check Environment Variables:**
    
    *   Verify that the environment variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` include the paths to the cuDNN library and binaries, respectively.
        
            
        `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH echo $PATH`
        
    *   Ensure that the directories containing cuDNN library files and binaries are listed in the output.
        
5.  **Check OpenCV CMake Configuration:**
    
    *   When configuring OpenCV with CMake, make sure that the cuDNN-related options are correctly set:
        
            
        `-D WITH_CUDA=ON \ -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \ -D OPENCV_DNN_CUDA=ON \`
        
    *   Check the CMake output for any messages related to cuDNN.
        

By performing these checks, you can verify the installation of cuDNN on your system. If everything is set up correctly, OpenCV should be able to detect and use cuDNN during the build process.



## Q: Explain: make clean && make
> **ChatGPT**

The command `make clean && make` is a sequence of two commands executed in a single line in a Bash shell. Let's break down each part:

1.  **`make clean`:**
    
    *   The `make clean` command is a target in a Makefile that is responsible for cleaning up the build artifacts. This typically involves deleting the compiled binaries, object files, and any other temporary files generated during the build process.
    *   This step ensures that the project is in a clean state, and you're starting with a fresh build.
2.  **`&&`:**
    
    *   The `&&` operator is a logical AND operator in Bash. In the context of a command line, it is used to execute the command on the right only if the command on the left succeeds (returns a zero exit status).
3.  **`make`:**
    
    *   After the `make clean` command completes successfully, the `make` command is executed. This command triggers the build process according to the rules defined in the Makefile.
    *   During this step, source files are compiled, object files are generated, and the final executable or libraries are built.

Combining these commands with `&&` ensures that the build process (`make`) is only executed if the clean-up process (`make clean`) is successful. If, for some reason, the clean-up fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the build process won't be initiated.

This sequence is commonly used to ensure that the build starts with a clean slate, reducing potential issues caused by residual files from previous builds. It's a good practice, especially when you want to make sure that the build environment is consistent and free from artifacts that might interfere with the new build.
